# 1 - This is tolerance (.002 translates to initial step size of dt =1, for distance of ~50 km)
# 2 - Mass of black hole
# 3 - where particles are initially read from
# 4 - set to 1 if you want to restrict domain. In this case, MUST recompile bhsim
# 5 - number of nearest neighbors
# 6 - TOTAL TIME EVOLVED - Total time T = 2e5. We need 1 MORE input for initial start time
# 7 - Is heating on? 2.6 if full heating, 0 if no heating.
